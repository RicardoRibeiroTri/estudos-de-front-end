# 🎨 Front-end Studies

Repository dedicated to my studies of **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

Here I record exercises, small projects, and practices developed during my learning process, exploring concepts such as:

- 🧱 Structuring with HTML  
- 🎨 Styling with CSS  
- ⚡ Interactivity with JavaScript  
- 📱 Responsiveness  
- 🧪 Tests and experiments  

The goal is to track my evolution in front-end development and gather everything I learn in one place.

🚀 Feel free to explore!
